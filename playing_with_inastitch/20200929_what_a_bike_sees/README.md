> What if you put a camera on each side of the front wheel and stitched them?

By stitching the two image, it should be possible to "see through" the front wheel. A point of view not otherwise possible without stitching.

Note: in this video seam calculation is left to automatic (using *GraphCut*). By choosing the seam in a smarter way, it should be possible to hide the wheels almost entirely.
